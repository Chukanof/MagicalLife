# Wizard
The base wizard class. 


Wizards can be beings of great power. A enemy attacks, they point a finger, whisper a few words, and it dies.
They can do just about anything you might imagine, if they know the right spell. Few wizards become beings of great power.
Those who do however, are not to be messed with.

One incident proving this occurred during the coronation of Lord Nilus.
Marmaducus, the greatest wizard alive, was present at the coronation.
Due to his status as lawful neutral, Lord Nilus was the only person that almost all of the gods could agree to obey.
The one exception to this almost unanimous agreement decided to take actions into his own hands.
Ceufroy, god of murder, secretly amassed an army of Chremes (magic resistant elite assassins, capable of killing gods).
He had them hide in Nilus's palace. During the coronation, they all moved out of the shadows, and attacked Nilus.
Marmaducus muttered a magical word, and pointed. All of Ceufroy's assassins were frozen in time. 
He then pointed at Ceufroy, who was in the middle of casting an escape spell. 
Marmaducus made an arcane gesture, whispered a magical phrase, and stripped Ceufroy of his power in Nilus's realm.

Wizards can cast any spell that they can read from their spellbook. Casting spells takes power. 
Some wizards are clever enough to store extra power in objects, such as an amulet.
If a wizard uses more power than they have stored in themselves or some trinket, they will hurt themselves.
