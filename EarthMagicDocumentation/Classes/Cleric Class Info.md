# Cleric

Clerics are magic users who pray to their god, Tali, for magic. A cleric is a powerful force against evil.
If a cleric has a holy symbol of Tali, they can use it to channel their faith. 
Their faith can be used like this to repel, damage, or destroy evil creatures.
A cleric at the height of their power can rival a wizard at the height of their power.
Where wizards damage and destroy, clerics heal and renew.
Where wizards summon hideous evil beings, clerics banish them and summon holy creatures.
While a powerful wizard could summon a demon prince, a powerful cleric could summon his/her god's partial attention.
