## Thief

Thieves are the staple of the adventuring world. Clear out a big dungeon? That's nice, but how are you going to get into the chest?
Thieves are renown for their ability to pickpocket, pick locks, hide in shadows, walk silently, detect traps, and disarm traps.
To increase their skills by level up, they must complete a heist of appropriate challenge for their level. If they are successful, they level up.
If they aren't, then they gotta try until they are.

Race Options: Human, Elf, Dwarf, Kender, Drow, Dragonborn, and Unspecified.
Alignment Options: Lawful Good, Chaotic Good, Lawful Neutral, True Neutral, Chaotic Neutral, Lawful Evil, Neutral Evil, and Chaotic Evil.
