<p>Some say that The Inevitable was the very first magical arrow.
Others say that it was the only sentient arrow ever made.
The only thing the legends agree on is The Inevitable is fueled by the souls of it's victims.
If The Inevitable cannot kill the entity it was shot at, it will attack creature's nearby until it kills one as a price for their betrayal.</p>
