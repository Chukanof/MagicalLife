# Angel Sword

Angel Swords are the weapon of choice for Angels. Lesser Angels normally wield 1 of these, with deadly grace. 
An Angel Warrior might wield 2 of these, with power and grace unknown to mortals.
An Angel Sword cannot be forged by anyone but an Angelic Blacksmith.
These blacksmiths feel no particular loyalty to Angels, but the Angelic plane is normally the most secure plane in existence.

A mortal cannot wield a angel sword. It would kill them.
