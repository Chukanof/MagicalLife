## Monk

Monks are a very powerful type of warrior. They are renown for fighting without weapons or armor.
A Monk can perform physical, mental, and magical feats that would be impossible, if they didn't have their faith.
Every monk worships and puts faith in their patron god or goddess. 
As they perform works of good or evil, their deity may reward or punish them.

Stunning blow: 

Upon reaching level 2, monks recieve training on how to perform a stunning blow. This attack uses the TH of the monk's fists, but if it hits it will stun the target. A sucessful save vs impact will reduce the amount of stunned time by half. An additional save vs impact will render the stun part of stunning blow, useless.
