## Monk

Monks are a very powerful type of warrior. They are renown for fighting without weapons or armor.
A Monk can perform physical, mental, and magical feats that would be impossible, if they didn't have their faith.
Every monk worships and puts faith in their patron god or goddess. 
As they perform works of good or evil, their deity may reward or punish them.
