# Ancient Grass

Intro:

In a small remote village, there was a young (boy/girl) and (his/her) mother. The little (boy/girl) always thought that (his/her) mother Mary was a very special person.
Life was quite and peaceful in the village. The (boy/girl) would help Mary scavenge for herbs in the forest.
They would use these herbs to create tonics and assorted remedies for the village's illnesses.
Mary was on the route to becoming a renown herbalist in the region, until one night everything changed.
(Player name) was sound asleep in (his/her) bed when there was a CRASH, as the door of their hut was broke into splinters.
A scary looking (man?) strode into the hut. It had red skin, two pointy horns, and projected an aura of fear. It's face had long jagged scars running down one side of it's face.
