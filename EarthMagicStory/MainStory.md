# Ancient Grass

Intro:

In a small remote village, there was a young (boy/girl) and (his/her) mother. The little (boy/girl) loved (his/her) mother, and always thought that (his/her) mother Mary was a very special person.
Life was quite and peaceful in the village. The (boy/girl) would help Mary scavenge for herbs in the forest.
They would use these herbs to create tonics and assorted remedies for the village's illnesses.
Mary was on the route to becoming a renown herbalist in the region, until one night everything changed.
(Player name) was sound asleep in (his/her) bed when there was a CRASH, as the door of their hut was broke into splinters.
Mary bolted awake, and pulled a concealed dagger from her boot.
A scary looking (man?) strode into the hut. It had red skin, two pointy horns, and projected an aura of fear. It's face had long jagged scars running down one side of it's face.
The little (boy/girl) shrunk into the shadows behind a wooden crate full of herbs. 
Mary rushed at it, and attempted to sink her dagger into the thing's heart.
It didn't even flinch, and allowed Mary to attack.
Her dagger bounced off of his skin, and sent her off balance.
It grabbed her with one hand, screamed "for the demon lord Azzar!" and killed her.
The demon whispers a few arcane words, and disappears.
