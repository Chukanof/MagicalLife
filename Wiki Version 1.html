    <h3>Monk</h3>
    <a name="AnchorMonk"></a>

    <p>
        Monks are a very powerful type of warrior. They are renown for fighting without weapons or armor.
        The only equipment that their god allows them to use is a robe.
        A Monk can perform physical, mental, and magical feats that would be impossible, if they didn't have their faith.
        Every monk worships and puts faith in their patron god or goddess.
        As they perform works of good or evil, their deity may reward or punish them.
        Whenever a monk is deemed ready to advance and they believe they are ready to advance, their deity will issue them a challenge.
        If they pass the challenge, they will advance to a higher rank of monk. If they fail, they are allowed to grow in power and character before trying again.

        Thieves are the staple of the adventuring world. Clear out a big dungeon? That's nice, but how are you going to get into the chest?
        Thieves are renown for their ability to pickpocket, pick locks, hide in shadows, walk silently, detect traps, and disarm traps.
        To increase their skills by level up, they must complete a heist of appropriate challenge for their level. If they are successful, they level up.
        If they aren't, then they gotta try until they are.
